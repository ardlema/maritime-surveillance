# Kafka Streams end to end demo

Through a hypothetical IoT scenario this project demonstrates how to combine the Kafka Streams API and a Tensorflow image recognition algorithm to predict smuggling activities.

We are using the Tensorflow image classifier algorithm from the [Machine Learning + Kafka Streams example](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/kafka-streams-machine-learning-examples) github repo.
